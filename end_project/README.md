## Resource Locator for the formerly incarcerated.

This resource locator is desinged for formerly incarerated individuals who are looking for re-entry services throughout New York City. The database will ask the user for general questions regarding their demographics and then display an array of community organizations for users to follow-up with.

This database was created to ease the burdens that the formerly incarcerated face when being turn away from organizations who do not serve persons with past criminal records. 

The resource locator contains three service categories that are essential for ex-felons to successfully reintergrate into mainstream society. Listed below are following services that can be obtained from the database:

1. Housing Services
2. Job Services
3. Healthcare Services
4. Geographic Map ** *(To identify resource location)* **

* **(Note)** *The information contained within the resource locator is housed within a data repository, which may not be 100 percent accurate. The database will be refreshed periodically and will be moved to a web-based application at a later date.*
